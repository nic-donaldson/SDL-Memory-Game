# SDL Memory Game

This is a colour memory game written in C++ with SDL.
To compile:
>     nic$ make

To play the game:
Press space to start a sequence, wait for it to complete.
Click the squares to make the sequence.
If you get it right, the colours will go funky for a little bit and you'll be able to start again.
The next time you play, the sequence will be one longer.
Squares are chosen randomly with no two same squares chosen in a row.

I give credit for some of the code (particularly timer.cpp) to [Lazy Foo' Productions](http://lazyfoo.net/).
Most of the knowledge I used to make this was learnt from [Lazy Foo' Productions](http://lazyfoo.net/).
